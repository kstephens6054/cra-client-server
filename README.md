> This package provides a boilerplate for a React client app using
create-react-app with an Express API server.

## How it works

The Webpack development server used by create-react-app provides a
proxy mechanism that avoids Cross-Origin Request Sharing (CORS) issues
by proxying requests to an external API server through the development
server.

## Install

```sh
npm install
```

## Run tests

```sh
cd ./client
npm run test
# or
cd ./server
npm run test
```
